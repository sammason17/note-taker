# note-taker
As a note to track pops in to mind, quickly record it down. I find this a useful way to track my thoughts with minimal disruption to flow and routine. All notes can then be viewed by looking up posts for that date. 

I have literaslly just started build so whilst the basic elements work and there is a UI, I am far from done, I want to update the UI and add more functionality such as deltion of records.

# dependencies
Feel free to use all you will need is the most recent version of Python (or anything past python 3 will do)

I have built this entire project with all built in libraries meaning the sys, sqlite3, tkinter, datetime, and os modules are built into Python, so you don't need to install them separately. You can use them in your Python programs simply by importing them.
